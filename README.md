## Why Motive?

Today's AI tools keep you hostage — Cursor locks you in a window, Claude Code blocks your terminal. Switch away, and you'll miss prompts or return to a stale `[Y/n]` that's been waiting for minutes.

**Motive lives in your menu bar.** AI works in the background. When it needs you, a lightweight popup drops down from the menu bar — no need to switch apps. One click, done, back to your flow.

| | Desktop Apps | CLI Tools | **Motive** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Where it lives** | App window | Terminal | Menu bar |
| **Permission prompts** | Buried in UI | Blocks terminal | Menu bar popup |
| **Switch apps?** | Miss responses | Hangs silently | AI finds you |

## Features

- **Intent-first** — Describe tasks in natural language, press Enter, done. No conversation needed.
- **True background execution** — AI works as a background process, like compiling or rendering.
- **Menu bar notifications** — Permission requests drop down from the menu bar, not buried in an app window.
- **Ambient status** — A subtle menu bar icon shows progress without demanding attention.
- **You are the final arbiter** — Like macOS system permission dialogs, you approve only what matters.
- **Local-first** — All data stays on your machine. Only AI API requests leave your device.
- **Native macOS** — Built with SwiftUI and AppKit. No Electron, no web views.
- **Multi-provider** — Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, or fully local with Ollama.

open Motive.xcodeproj
```

The OpenCode binary is bundled automatically during release builds. For development, place it at `Motive/Resources/opencode`.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later
- API key for Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, or local Ollama setup

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Cursor / Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Gemini CLI?</strong></summary>

**Desktop apps** (Cursor, Claude Desktop) are **window-locked** — you must stay in their interface.

**CLI tools** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) are **terminal-locked** — if you switch away, the terminal hangs waiting for input. You come back to find a cryptic `[Y/n]` prompt that's been sitting there for 20 minutes.

**Motive** lives in your menu bar — the AI runs as a background process. When it needs your input, a popup drops down from the menu bar. One click, done, back to your flow.

Think: desktop apps are like a colleague who insists you sit in their office. CLI tools are like someone who emails you but marks it "urgent" with no notification. Motive is like a colleague who taps your shoulder only when necessary, handles everything else autonomously.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does Motive need Accessibility permission?</strong></summary>

To register the global hotkey (`⌥Space`) that summons the command bar from anywhere. Without it, you'd need to click the menu bar icon every time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data sent to the cloud?</strong></summary>

Motive is local-first. Sessions and history stay on your machine. The only network traffic is API requests to your chosen AI provider. Use Ollama for 100% offline operation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use a local LLM?</strong></summary>

Yes. Select Ollama as your provider and point it to your local instance. Zero cloud dependency.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What can Motive do?</strong></summary>

Anything an AI coding agent can do: refactor code, generate files, run scripts, organize projects, write docs, and more. Motive passes your intent to OpenCode, which has full filesystem and terminal access.
</details>

## Roadmap

### Completed
- [x] **Multi-language UI** — English, 简体中文, 日本語
- [x] **Browser automation** — Full support for web scraping, form filling, and browser-based workflows
- [x] **Skills System** — 50+ bundled skills (weather, GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc.) with easy enable/disable in Settings
- [x] **Custom Skills** — User-defined skills via `~/.motive/skills/` directory, no code required

### In Progress
- [ ] **Multi-task queue** — Task queuing with parallel execution for independent tasks and sequential processing for dependent ones
- [ ] **Task resume** — Interrupt and resume long-running tasks, preserving state across app restarts

### Planned
- [ ] **Personal Profile** — Store personal context (name, preferences, work style) for more relevant AI responses
- [ ] **Memory & RAG** — Long-term memory with retrieval-augmented generation for context-aware assistance
- [ ] **Task templates** — Save and reuse common task patterns with customizable parameters
