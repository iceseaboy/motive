## Why Motive?

Traditional AI interfaces demand your attention. You type, wait, watch, respond, wait again. That's fine for questions—but absurd for tasks.

**Motive inverts this paradigm.** Describe what you want, then forget about it. The AI works silently in the background. You get interrupted only when a decision is needed.

Think of it as a competent colleague who handles tasks autonomously and only taps your shoulder when necessary.

## Features

- **Intent-first interaction** — Describe tasks in natural language via a Spotlight-like command bar
- **Background execution** — AI works while you focus on other things
- **Minimal interruption** — Permission requests and decisions surface only when required
- **Ambient status** — A subtle menu bar indicator shows progress without demanding attention
- **Local-first** — All data stays on your machine. Nothing is sent to the cloud except AI model requests.
- **Native experience** — Built with SwiftUI and AppKit for seamless macOS integration
- **Multi-provider** — Works with Claude, OpenAI, or local Ollama
