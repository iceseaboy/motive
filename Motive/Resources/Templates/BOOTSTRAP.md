# Welcome to Your Motive Workspace

This is your personal AI workspace. The files here define who your AI assistant is and how it behaves.

## Files

- **SOUL.md** - Core personality and values
- **IDENTITY.md** - Name, emoji, and character traits
- **USER.md** - Information about you for personalization
- **AGENTS.md** - Workspace rules and project conventions

## Getting Started

1. Open IDENTITY.md and give your assistant a name and emoji
2. Add some info about yourself in USER.md
3. Customize SOUL.md if you want a different personality

The assistant will read these files and embody the persona you define.
