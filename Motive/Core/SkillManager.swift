            description: "Ask users questions via the UI. The user CANNOT see CLI output - this tool is the ONLY way to communicate with them.",
            content: """
            Use this MCP tool to ask users questions and get their responses.
            This is the **ONLY** way to communicate with the user - they cannot see CLI/terminal output.
            
            ## Critical Rule
            
            The user **CANNOT** see your text output or CLI prompts!
            
            If you write "Let me ask you..." and then just output text - **THE USER WILL NOT SEE IT**.
            You MUST call this tool to display a modal in the UI.
            
            ## ⛔ MANDATORY: "options" ARRAY IS REQUIRED
            
            Every call MUST include an "options" array with 2-4 choices.
            Calls WITHOUT options will FAIL and break the UI.
            
            ## When to Use
            
            - Clarifying questions before starting ambiguous tasks
            - Asking user preferences (e.g., "How would you like files organized?")
            - Confirming actions before executing (especially destructive/irreversible ones)
            - Getting approval for sensitive actions (financial, messaging, deletion, etc.)
            - Any situation where you need user input to proceed
            
            ## Parameters
            
            ```json
            {
              "questions": [{
                "question": "Your question to the user",
                "header": "Short label (max 12 chars)",
                "options": [
                  { "label": "Option 1", "description": "What this does" },
                  { "label": "Option 2", "description": "What this does" }
                ],
                "multiSelect": false
              }]
            }
            ```
            
            - `question` (required): The question text to display
            - `header` (optional): Short category label, shown as modal title (max 12 chars)
            - `options` (⛔ REQUIRED): Array of selectable choices (2-4 recommended)
            - `multiSelect` (optional): Allow selecting multiple options (default: false)
            
            **Custom text input:** To allow users to type their own response, include an option with label "Other".
            
            ## Examples
            
            ### Asking about preferences
            
            ```
            AskUserQuestion({
              "questions": [{
                "question": "How would you like to organize your files?",
                "header": "Organize",
                "options": [
                  { "label": "By file type", "description": "Group into Documents, Images, etc." },
                  { "label": "By date", "description": "Group by month/year" },
                  { "label": "Other", "description": "Let me specify" }
                ]
              }]
            })
            ```
            
            ### Confirming an action
            
            ```
            AskUserQuestion({
              "questions": [{
                "question": "Found multiple matches. Which file do you want?",
                "header": "Select",
                "options": [
                  { "label": "file1.pdf", "description": "Modified yesterday" },
                  { "label": "file2.pdf", "description": "Modified last week" },
                  { "label": "All of them", "description": "Process all matches" }
                ]
              }]
            })
            ```
            
            ## Response Format
            
            - `User selected: Option 1` - Single selection
            - `User selected: Option A, Option B` - Multiple selections (if multiSelect: true)
            - `User responded: [custom text]` - If user typed a custom response via "Other"
            - `User declined to answer the question.` - If user dismissed the modal
            
            ## Wrong vs Correct
            
            **WRONG** (user won't see this):

            Use this MCP tool to request user permission before performing **WRITE** file operations.
            
            ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Reading Does NOT Require Permission
            
            **DO NOT call this tool for:**
            - Reading file contents (Read tool)
            - Listing directory contents (Glob, LS)

            2. ONLY IF response is "allowed": Proceed with the file operation
            3. IF "denied": Stop and inform the user via AskUserQuestion
            
            ## Parameters
            
            ```json

            }
            ```
            
            ## Operations
            
            | Operation | Use When |
            |-----------|----------|
            | `create` | Creating a new file that doesn't exist |
            | `delete` | Removing a file or directory |
            | `rename` | Changing a file's name (same directory) |
            | `move` | Moving a file to a different directory |
            | `modify` | Editing content within an existing file |
            | `overwrite` | Replacing entire file content |
            
            ## Examples
            
            Single file:
            ```
            request_file_permission({

            ## Safe File Deletion Rule
            
            Before deleting ANY file, you MUST:
            
            1. Call `request_file_permission` with `operation: "delete"`
            2. For multiple files, use `filePaths` array (batch into one prompt, not multiple calls)
            3. Wait for response
            4. Only proceed if "allowed"
            5. If "denied", acknowledge and do NOT delete
            
            ## Applies To
            
            - `rm` commands (single or multiple files)
            - `rm -rf` (directories)
            - `unlink`, `fs.rm`, `fs.rmdir`
            - Any script or tool that deletes files
            - Trash/recycle operations
            
            ## No Workarounds
            
            Never bypass deletion by:
            - Emptying files instead of deleting
            - Moving to hidden/temp locations
            - Using obscure commands
            - Claiming it's "just cleanup"

            WRONG (never do this):
            ```bash
            rm /path/to/file.txt
            ```
            
            CORRECT (always do this):
            ```
            request_file_permission({ operation: "delete", filePath: "/path/to/file.txt" })
            → Wait for "allowed"

            ## Examples
            
            ```bash
            # Shopping
            browser-use-sidecar \(headedFlag)agent_task "去淘宝搜索卫生纸并挑选一款加入购物车"
            
            # Search
            browser-use-sidecar \(headedFlag)agent_task "Search Google for iPhone 16 reviews"
            
            # Form
            browser-use-sidecar \(headedFlag)agent_task "Fill contact form on example.com with name John"
            ```
            
            ## Response Handling - CRITICAL POLLING LOOP
            
            **After calling `agent_task`, you MUST poll `agent_status` until task completes!**
            
            **Status types:**
            - `"running"` - Task in progress, WAIT 3-5 seconds then call `agent_status` again
            - `"need_input"` - Agent needs user choice, use AskUserQuestion then `agent_continue`
            - `"completed"` - Done successfully
            - `"error"` - Failed
            
            ## MANDATORY Workflow
            
            ```bash
            # Step 1: Start task
            browser-use-sidecar \(headedFlag)agent_task "去淘宝买卫生纸"
            # Returns: {"status": "running", ...}
            
            # Step 2: POLL status (repeat until NOT "running")
            sleep 5  # Wait a few seconds
            browser-use-sidecar agent_status
            # If still "running", repeat step 2
            # If "need_input", go to step 3
            # If "completed" or "error", done
            
            # Step 3: Handle need_input (if status is "need_input")
            # Response example: {"status": "need_input", "question": "选择哪款?", "options": ["A", "B"]}
            # -> Use AskUserQuestion to show options to user
            # -> After user picks "A":
            browser-use-sidecar agent_continue "A"
            # -> Then go back to step 2 (poll status again)
            
            # Step 4: When completed
            browser-use-sidecar close
            ```
            
            ## Progressive Clarification (Required)
            
            Minimize user questions. Only ask when necessary.
            
            If the task is ambiguous:
            - Phase 1 (coarse): ask for high-level constraints that narrow the search space.
              Examples: goal, priority, budget/time range, scope, preference direction.
            - Phase 2 (concrete): AFTER you have real candidates (from the web page or results),
              ask the user to choose among those concrete options via AskUserQuestion.
            
            Do NOT ask for concrete choices before real candidates exist.
            
            ## Key Commands
            
            - `agent_task "description"` - Start autonomous browser task
            - `agent_status` - Check task progress (MUST call repeatedly while running)
            - `agent_continue "choice"` - Continue after user input
            - `close` - Close browser when done
            """,
            type: .capability,
            enabled: enabled
        )
    }
}
